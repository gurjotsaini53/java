The programming adv of collection framework

Reduces programming efforts
Increases Proformance -- high performance implementation of data structures and algorithms.


collection

1. List                                         2. Queue                                     set
- ArrayList                                    - deque                                     haskset,
- LinkedList                                   -  ArrayDeque
- vector- stack                                 - priority Queue


Map
SortedMap,TreeMap
hashMap , LinkedHashMap
HashTable

Collection Framework
It has rules and Exceptions


The root collection in the collection hierarchy.
A Collection represents a group of objets


Collection do not work with primitive data type
We have to use Wrapper classes

ArrayList

                                Collection<String> player = new ArrayList<String>();

An ordered collection (also known as a sequence)
The user of this interfsce has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted.

The user can access elements by their integer index (position in the list).
and search for element in the list.

                                List<String> player = new ArrayList<String>();

     * (array list)
     Ordered collection
     Duplicate Value
     Not Synchronized


     An Array list is  resizeable array also called a dynamic array.
     Its grows its size  to accommodate new elements and shrinks the size when size is removed.

     array list internally uses an array to store elements just like array it alos allow you to retrieve the elements
     it alow you to retrive array elements by their index.

     java array list allows null values.

                             ArrayList<String> player = new ArrayList<String>();



 special contructor
 Contructs an empty list with the specified initial capacity.




 Accessing elements using forEach loop
