An I/O stream represent an input source or an output destination



Stream supports many different kinds of data, including simple bytes, primitive data type , localized characters , and objects
some streams pass on data , others manipulate and transform the data in useful ways.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-A stream is a sequence of data
-A program uses an input stream to read data from a source , one item at a time.
-A program uses an output stream to write data to a destination , one item at time.

System.out.println("Hello World")   // output stream obj methods


Type I/0 Streams

--- Unbuffered I/O streams
--- Buffered I/O Streams

Actual
--- Byte Streams            // unbuffered
--- Character Streams         // buffered
--- Data Streams
--- Object Streams


-----------------------------------------------------------
(Byte Streams)
Byte Stream is used to read and write a single byte (8 bits) of data.
All byte stream classes are derived from base abstract classes called InputStream and OutputStream.



(Character Stream)
Character Stream is used to read and write a single character of data.
All the character stream classes are derived from base abstract classes called Reader and Writer.
