java generics allow you to create a single class, interface and methods that
can be used with differenct type of data (objects).


This help us to reuse our code

Node : Generic does not work with primitive data type (int , char, float etc.)


in java2

Box integerBox = new Box();

in java 5

Box<Integer> intergerBox = new Box<Interger>();

in java7

Box<Integer> integerBox=  new Box<>();


the core idea behind generic if programmers could express their internsion to use
specific type and the compiler ensured the correctness of such types.
