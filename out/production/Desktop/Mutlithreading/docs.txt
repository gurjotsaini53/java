Concurrency--------

Multithreading

concurrency is the ability to do more at same time.

Running multiple parts of a single application simultaneously is also termed as concurrency.

Basic unit of concurrency is process and thread
..
A process is a program in execution.
It has its own address space , a call stack , link to anu resource such as open files.
A computer system normally has multiple processes running at a time.
The operating system keeps tracks of all these processes and facilitates their execution


----------------------
 A thread is a path of execution within a process.
 Every process has at least one thread called the main thread. The main thread can create additional thread within the process.

 Threads within a process share the process;s resources including memory and open file.
 However every single thread has its own call stack.


 since thread share the smae address space of the process, creating









 concurrency and parallelism .


 Mutlithreading is the process of executing two or more threads of the same process simultaneously.


 how to create a thread ?
 there are two ways of creating a thread.
 1. By extending a thread class.
 2. By implementing a runnable interface.


it in never legal to start a thread more than once.

        (implements )        (extends)
runnable      <-     thread       <-         objects


Thread class vs Runnable interface




java.lang.enum class contains a static state enum- which defines its potential states. during any given point of time.
The thread can be only in one state.

1. NEW  - a new created thread that has not yet started the execution.
2. RUNNABLE - either running or ready for execution but it's execution but it waiting for resource allocation
3. BLOCKED - waiting to acquire a monitor lock to enter or re-enter a synchrinized block/methods.
4. WAITING - waiting for some other thread to perform a particular action without any time limit.
5. TIMED_WAITING - waiting for some other thread to perform a specific action for a specified period.
6. TERMINATED - has completed its execution.


------------------------------------


A new thread (or a new born thread ) is created not yet started
