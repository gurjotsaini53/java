Basic unit of concurrency is process and thread
..
A process is a program in execution.
It has its own address space , a call stack , link to anu resource such as open files.
A computer system normally has multiple processes running at a time.
The operating system keeps tracks of all these processes and facilitates their execution


----------------------
 A thread is a path of execution within a process.
 Every process has at least one thread called the main thread. The main thread can create additional thread within the process.

 Threads within a process share the process;s resources including memory and open file.
 However every single thread has its own call stack.


 since thread share the smae address space of the process, creating









 concurrency and parallelism .


 Mutlithreading is the process of executing two or more threads of the same process simultaneously.


 how to create a thread ?
 there are two ways of creating a thread.
 1. By extending a thread class.
 2. By implementing a runnable interface.


it in never legal to start a thread more than once.

        implements  extends
runnable <- thread <- objects


Thread class vs Runnable interface
